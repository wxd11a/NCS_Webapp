This is a web application for the National Credentialing Service built by a group of students at Abilene Christian University.

The aim of this project is to develop this web application in a formal manner with hard deadlines, documentation, collaboration between the project group and the client. We are to build a system for NCS (National Credentialing Service) employees and the practitioners that interact with the company.
